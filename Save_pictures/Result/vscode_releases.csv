In addition to releasing a preview of [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/), we announced in the [October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134730) that we would focus on housekeeping GitHub issues and pull requests (see our [issue cleanup guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Grooming)). Across all of our VS Code repositories, we closed (either triaged or fixed) **4163** issues. While we closed issues, you created **2222** new issues. The main [vscode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) now has **2491** open feature requests and **1246** open bugs. In addition, we closed **194** pull requests.

As in previous years, we used the [live tracker](https://vscode-issue-tracker.netlify.com/) from [Benjamin Lannon](https://github.com/lannonbr) to track our progress:

![Burn down chart of VS Code issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/raw/main/release-notes/images/1_62/october-issue-cleanup.png)

Given the focus on shipping `vscode.dev`, not everybody on the team had cycles for clean-up, so some issue clean-up will continue in November. After housekeeping, we also addressed feature requests and community [pull requests](#pull-requests).
